For half of my waking hours, I'm lucky enough to be Director of the Genome Sequence Informatics group at [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca). The other half of my time is spent writing novels and doing crafty things. I live in Toronto with my lovely husband who tolerates my ever-growing stash of yarn.
