## About meeeeee

<!--<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>-->

For half of her waking hours, Morgan Taschuk is Senior Manager of the Genome
Sequence Informatics group at [Ontario Institute for Cancer
Research](https://oicr.on.ca). The other
half is spent in writing novels and doing crafty things. She lives in Toronto
with her lovely husband who tolerates her ever-growing stash of yarn.

Yes, she has two Twitter accounts:

- [@morgantaschuk](https://twitter.com/morgantaschuk), for programming and bioinformatics
- [@50storieslater](https://twitter.com/50storieslater), for writing-related things
