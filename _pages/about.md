For half of my waking hours, I'm lucky enough to be Senior Manager of the Genome
Sequence Informatics group at [Ontario Institute for Cancer
Research](https://oicr.on.ca). The other
half of my time is spent writing novels and doing crafty things. I live in Toronto
with my lovely husband who tolerates my ever-growing stash of yarn.

Yes, I have two Twitter accounts:

- [@morgantaschuk](https://twitter.com/morgantaschuk), for programming and bioinformatics
- [@50storieslater](https://twitter.com/50storieslater), for writing-related things
