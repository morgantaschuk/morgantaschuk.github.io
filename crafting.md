## Crafting

<!--<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>-->

I like projects where I can use my own hands to make something. Bonus if it's
fiddly and detailed.
I knit and crochet.
I papercraft.
I build models.
I do woodwork.
I make pottery.
And it turns out I also make websites.
