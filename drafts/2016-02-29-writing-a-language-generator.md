excerpt: "So I made up my own language"
---

Every fantasy writer, like me, has probably considered creating a fantasy
language. Unlike many writers, this idea excites me! I've spent a ridiculous
amount of time figuring out the sounds, letter combinations, conjugations, and
word order. I've created a new writing style and developed the tools that
accompany it. After a few weeks of effort, I have a proto-language for my
characters to use.

(I don't speak any languages other than English, although
I've tried pretty hard for English and German. So my language is heavily
influenced by those languages. I'm not too worried about it.)

To quickly populate my new language, I found a list of the 1000 most commonly
used words in English. And then I hit my first hurdle: Who wants to make up
over one thousand words using a very specifically devised set of rules for
letter combinations? Not me!

In my day job, I write software, so my answer was clear: python to the rescue!
I wrote a little script that would generate words for me!
